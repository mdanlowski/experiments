### My take on a travelling salesman problem
  Goals:
  - [x] implement the algorithm visualization script (at first, the nodes will be randomly swapped until the shortest path is found)
        - result: works quite fine for short sets (up to 7 nodes)
  - [ ] implement and understand the Lexical Ordering
  - [ ] implement and understand other sorting methods //TODO
